## ThreeFold’s August 2020 Community Updates

Dear ThreeFold Community,

We hope that all is well in your world since our last update. A lot has happened since our [July Update 2020](https://wiki.threefold.io/ThreeFold%20update%20doc%20July%202020.pdf), therefore we would like to update you on our achievements and community news.

### ThreeFold Updated Website Launch

Last month, ThreeFold has been working on updating our web presence, which includes an improvement in our messaging and navigation about our technologies and ecosystem; making the information more actionable and easier for the audience to understand.

The new updated [website (staging preview)](https://www2.threefold.io) is currently in the final stage of development and will be launched at the end of the first week of August 2020. We are also working on a new version of our wiki site (knowledgebase). If you want to collaborate and/or leave remarks, please use our open source community based code management system on our website's [Github repository](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_tfgrid/issues)

> please note, this is not the final version, updates are ongoing.

### Introducing: ThreeFold_Grid Marketplace on production net (beta)

ThreeFold Foundation is proud to announce that the [ThreeFold_Grid Marketplace](https://marketplace.grid.tf/) is live in beta on the production grid. The ThreeFold_Grid Marketplace allows you to quickly deploy solutions on top of the ThreeFold_Grid.

### Introducing: TF Marketplace 2.2 Demo & Grid-hosted 3bot on testnet (alpha)

- [**TF NOW Demo**](cloud:evdc_marketplace): hosted environment for solution deployment using easy walkthrough wizards.
- [**3Bot**](cloud:evdc_getting_started): a hosted environment for advanced cloud solution deployment using a 3Bot.

Start your 3bot (as virtual system administrator) on the ThreeFold_Grid.

_Integrated full blown admin panel, private & fully decentralized per user.
Easy to use_

_Integrated dashboard_

The new 3bot is a very cool new feature of our ThreeFold_Grid which gives a lot of flexibility & power for technical users. The possibilities are endless.

### Introducing: End User Apps

We have been talking about this for a while, enduser apps on the grid.

![](img/enderuserapps.png)

By the end of Summer, September at the latest, a first version of this solution will be live on our grid with at least an office suite, browser on the grid, and a Zoom alternative. This is an opensource solution created by members of our community and will probably use the name https://digitalyou.online

> Our approach to enduser apps is enabling lots of partners to onboard their apps (experiences) on top of our grid. Our aim for 2021, +1 millions endusers on the grid, very ambitious but possible if we work with the right partners.

### Stellar Blockchain and Wallet

We would like to remind you again that ThreeFold Foundation has migrated our underlying blockchain technology from Rivine to Stellar for its technical, cost, and advanced blockchain ecosystem benefits. Please check the [July 2020 Updates](threefold_update_july2020) for more details. We hope you are already using the new wallet (3Bot Connect) and see your TFT balance in the wallet. If you have any questions, or need assistance in migrating to the new wallet, please do not hesitate to reach out to us using our [Helpdesk Chat](https://threefoldfaq.crisp.help/en/).

### July Poll ThreeFold Results

Earlier this month we conducted a poll of TFT holders regarding our recent updates. Here are the results of the poll with 127 votes as of July 31 2020 (weighted counts):

##### TFTA on Stellar rights

- 98.32% people agreed on TFTA (Stellar) as an equivalent to TFTv1 (Rivine) while 1.68% disagree.

##### TFTA Trading Mechanism Support

- 93.98% agreed to sell TFTA (TFTv1) on the Stellar exchange / other decentralized market mechanisms and get automatic conversion to TFTv2 (TFT) by the end of the year.
- 5.52% want TFTA to be available on supported exchanges as TFT, and agree with minimal price protection (0.15 USD, +2% increase per month starting with May 1), with sales happening through a sales-bot.
- 0.5% want TFTA to be available on supported exchanges as TFT without price protection.

#### TFTv1 (TFTA) to TFTv2 Conversion

We are very happy that we have received 98% (weighted) community support for the migration to Stellar Blockchain and Liquid & BTC Alpha public exchange integration. There is a staggering 99.5% support for the price protection system as introduced by ThreeFold Foundation in relation to the public exchanges Liquid & BTC Alpha.

Unfortunately there are some malicious attempts by some former community members to discredit the motivations of the ThreeFold Foundation in relation to the organization of the TGP (Token Grant Program) and the public exchange launch. We do not want to be in this position, and as such we believe that it's better to allow anyone who wants to move from TFTv1 to TFTv2 to do so at any point in time. It will be up to the community to show their support for the project. While we still believe it's best to have a price protection system in place, we are unable to do it unless we have 100% support from the community.

TFTv1 (TFTA) will remain and will become our voluntary staking pool. **You can show your support for the ThreeFold Movement by keeping your TFTv1 (TFTA)**, and only when you feel the need to trade, you can freely migrate your TFTv1 to TFTv2. This will show the community that you want to hold on to your TFT for the future and show your support for the movement that way.

Please keep in mind that the TFT represents IT capacity and is not meant to be used as a speculative digital currency. The TFT is the unit of value exchange on the TF Grid and can potentially grow in liquidity and value as the result of the expansion of the grid and the usage of the grid.

**The current liquidity on the public exchanges is low.** It will be the responsibility of the community to only sell the TFT at a price in line with value which is being created. Please check our simulation section on our wiki to see the potential of the growth of the grid and how it relates to the potential value increase of the grid and TFT.

Please keep in mind that as an organization, ThreeFold Foundation (ThreeFold_Dubai)’s main and only interest is to promote and expand the ThreeFold_Grid. The upgrade of the token from Rivine to Stellar resulted in extra benefits (performance, bigger community and integrated exchange). This upgrade was communicated to the community starting 1 year ago using multiple channels and over multiple meetings. The TFTv2 and TFTv1 are exactly the same token with the same rights, the only difference was a price protection system implemented by ThreeFold Foundation to the benefit of the community. This price protection system will be removed within 1 week.

This week instructions how to migrate between versions will be published on our wiki. Please allow us to remind you, our project has only been active for a little over 2 years; grid utilization and expansion are the key factors that would drive the value of the token, not velocity (trading volumes) or hype. Please be responsible in selling your TFT on public exchanges.

### Farming Cooperatives on ThreeFold_Grid 2.2

We are also glad to announce that ThreeFold Foundation has on-boarded [BetterToken](https://bettertoken.com/) and [Mazraa](https://www.mazraa.io/) on ThreeFold_Grid v2.2. Mazraa and Bettertoken are Farming Cooperatives that help farmers to become active on the ThreeFold_Grid. They are also able to help their own customers to deploy services and solutions on top of the ThreeFold_Grid.

### Community AMA: Thursday 13 Aug

ThreeFold is organizing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) that will happen Thursday 13th Aug at 5pm CEST. Zoom will be used as a communication mechanism, being on video is highly appreciated. Please send us your questions in advance via email to info@threefold.io. This will allow us to organize the AMA better. During the call you can also use the chat function to ask questions.
