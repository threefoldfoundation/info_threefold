# ThreeFold Blockchains

In our solution, we use our blockchain technology to run multiple blockchain instances. For our digital currency it will be the Stellar blockchain and for storing and getting consensus around data it is the BCDB.

# White Paper Takeaways 

1. Blockchain technology is here to stay but is not the single answer to the exponential growth requirements of digital services.
2. Centralization of data ownership and storage is not bad if the owner is the creator of the data, not the aggregator.
3. A new technology paradigm is needed to bring blockchain technologies and decentralized compute and storage together.
