### ThreeFold Paradigm Shift: Serverless Circular Architecture

TheeFold Tech has invented a new paradigm for Information & Communication Technology. A purely centralized approach is not desirable – neither is replicating data and compute processing 100 times. 

The solution: every person or organization becomes the center of their digital life. Each entity gets a digital avatar (a.k.a. 3Bot)  which is responsible for all data storage & processing and yet offers interfaces to allow any app to work with it. 


The result is a dramatic improvement in security, efficiency, and cost. There is virtually no limit of scale to this approach. To allow the 3Bots to exist, a self-driving, self-healing IT system had to be created.

Today the 3bot is used in the TFGrid to be your virtual system administrator.
