# Tools Used For ThreeFold

## project/task management

### if content/code related

- github (wiki, websites, promotion)

### if coordination/business

- circles tool
- integrates with threefold connect
- we will make better reporting tool (has been promised for a long time)
- how to use our circles tool see [howto_circles_projects](tfhowto_circlestools)

## content 

All info needs to be in one of below ...

### wiki (publishtools)

> use as much as possible.

Link customers/proposals to wiki's as much as possible.

Its easy to create new wiki's and link to it.

why

- version controlled
- easy to use as single source of truth

remark

- can edit using publishing tools on own computer (more advanced)
- can edit directly using github or [docs.threefold.me](http://docs.grid.tf/)
- [docs.threefold.me](http://docs.grid.tf/) is used when really private and cannot be on MS owned github

### cryptpad

> every document for customer which is not wiki or proposal or legal or marketing <BR>
> everything which needs to be more private/secure

When not to use cryptpad

- document needs to be nicely formatted (pdf)
  - presentations + marketing docs which need visual pleasing ...
- contracts in gdrive (contracts not in old school office !!!!!!)

remark

- is also very usable for collaborating on e.g. a markdown doc before copying to cryptpad
- ALWAYS MAKE LINKS BETWEEN GDRIVE/CRYPTPAD where needed !!! e.g. on funnel issue or other story

### gdrive

Any other document

- [Link to the root of the Circles Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ww8CF3zPCVKhlyAhWO9WCqZZoHhA2hBl)
- [READ THIS IMPORTANT HOWTO](strategy:tfhowto_gdrive)

> we cannot work on any project if the info is not nicely organized in one of above

**allways use gdrive for**

- contracts
- big files
- presentations (use master slides with right templates)
- visual docs

## future tools

- the digital twin + publishing tools (but more easy to use) will become the default for everything
- all stories, funnels, tasks, issues will be managed starting from text
- documents will be on digital twins
