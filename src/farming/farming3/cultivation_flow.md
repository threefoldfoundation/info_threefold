# Cultivation Flow

This document describes how TFT are used to buy capacity from the TFGrid by means of using our TF_Channels.

Below table is only relevant for CU/SU revenue.

### When capacity bought by Certified Sales Channel

We expect most of the business for next 6 months to come through our certified sales channels

- [ ] 25% needs to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation 
- [ ] 10% to farmer 
- [ ] the remainder goes to certified sales channel (can be multi level, as organized by ThreeFold)

### When capacity bought by person as referred to by farmer.

- [ ] 25% to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation
- [ ] 50% to Farmer (because farmer found the user of the grid, CU/SU only)
- [ ] the remainder goes to sales channel (can be multi level, as organized by ThreeFold)


### When capacity bought by Farmer itself

- [ ] 25% needs to be burned
- [ ] 75% to farmer

### When capacity bought by any Grid User

We expect this to be small in beginning

- [ ] 25% to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation
- [ ] 10% to farmer
- [ ] the remainder goes to promotion pool as held by wisdom council to promote & support sales & utilization
